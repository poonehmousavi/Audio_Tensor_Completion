# Audio_Tensor_Completion
Tensor Completion Algorithms for Estimating Missing Values in Audio Domain

In this project, various tensor completion methodologies
will be applied to a specific kind of data, i.e. sound spectro-
gram. As it will be depicted in section 2, data completion
has been a widely studied subject showing impressive per-
formances to recover and fill missing data. However, most
applications were made on images or movies. The structure
of images is rather specific and the question of whether the
methodologies could also be applied to drastically different
data structures will be tested throughout this project.
